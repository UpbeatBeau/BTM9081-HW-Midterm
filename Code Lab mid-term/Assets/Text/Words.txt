One of my favorite things to do is to take a walk in the forrest
You are able to be alone with your thoughts and it calms you
I also see a good hike as a great metaphor for what life is like
paticularly troubling times
sometimes the path is winding and confusing
other times you feel like you know where to go
but it seems like youve been there before
and you are going in a circle
until you finally see the way out
and then you discover
something new that you didnt even know was on the path
